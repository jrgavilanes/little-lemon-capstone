# App Capstone for Meta Android Developer Professional Certificate


Course syllabus
Introduction

This reading will give you an overview of what you will cover in this Capstone Project course. 

To complete this course, you need the  Android app development experience that the previous courses in the Android Developer program provided you with. At this point in the program, you've gained all the skills that you need to successfully complete the Capstone Project. With this project, you can demonstrate the multiple skills you’ve gained so far but also create a portfolio piece that you can use to impress potential employers.

The course consists of four modules:

    Starting the project

    Project functionality

    Project assessment       

During this course, you will be guided through the process of building an app by combining all the skills and technologies you've learned throughout this program. You will be required to build an Android app for ordering food from the Little Lemon restaurant. Each module includes a brief recap of, and links to, content that you have covered in previous courses in this program, guiding you through the app development process.
Module 1: Starting the project

This introductory module will give you some general information about the Capstone Project. You'll also revisit the process of setting up your coding environment, tracking your code using Git and planning the UX and UI of your app. The purpose is to guide you through setting up and beginning your work on the project.

By the end of this module, you will have completed the following:

    Setting up a Jetpack Compose app using Android Studio

    Tracking your project using version control tools, specifically Git and GitHub

    Planning the UX and UI of your app with processes such as project wireframing, creating key components and applying design fundamentals in Figma

Module 2: Project functionality

At the start of the second module, you will be guided through the process of creating an onboarding flow for your app. You will also set up the navigation for your app and create a user profile page.

    Setting up the UI for the elements on the home screen such as the menu for your app

Module 3: Project assessment

In the third module, you will be assessed on the fundamental skills covered as you build the Capstone Project's functionality. You'll have a chance to compare your code and your designs with your peers via a peer review, as well as work through a solution to some of the most challenging parts of the Capstone Project. At the end of this module, you'll complete a graded assessment, reflect on your learning and be guided to the next steps in your developer journey. This module also includes an optional lesson about how to publish your app to the Google Play Store. This will provide you with useful tips about the submission process and how to test and update your app.

By the end of this module, you will have completed the following:

    Submitting your developed app and evaluating some of your peers’ projects

    Completing a final graded quiz in which you synthesize the skills from this program

    Reflecting on your learning and the next steps in your developer journey
